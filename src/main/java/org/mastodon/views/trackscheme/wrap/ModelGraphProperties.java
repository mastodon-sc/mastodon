/**
 * Interface for accessing model graph properties.
 * <p>
 * To make {@link TrackSchemeGraph} adaptable to various model graph type
 * without requiring the graph to implement specific interfaces, we access
 * properties of model vertices and edges (for example the label of a vertex)
 * through {@link ModelGraphProperties}.
 * <p>
 * For model graphs that implement the required additional interfaces (
 * {@link HasTimepoint}, {@link HasLabel}, etc),
 * {@link DefaultModelGraphProperties} can be used.
 *
 * @param <V>
 *            the type of vertices in the model graph (not the TrackScheme
 *            graph).
 * @param <E>
 *            the type of edges in the graph.
