# Mastodon – a large-scale tracking and track-editing framework for large, multi-view images.

Modern microscopy technologies such as light sheet microscopy allows live sample *in toto* 3D imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution. Such images will be 3D over time, possibly multi-channels and multi-view. Computational analysis of these images promises new insights in cellular, developmental and stem cells biology. However, a single image can amount to several terabytes, and in turn, the automated or semi-automated analysis of these large images can generate a vast amount of annotations. The challenges of big data are then met twice: first by dealing with a very large image, and second with generating large annotations from this image. They will make interacting and analyzing the data especially difficult.

**Mastodon** is our effort to provide a tool that can harness these challenges. 

## *Warning.*

Despite the naming of the artifacts and the apparent usability of the software, *Mastodon is still in alpha stage, not released, not published and not supported* at the present time.

## Mastodon goals.

The goals of Mastodon are the following:

- **Interactive** browsing, inspection and navigation through the image data. Fast and responsive.
- Build **tracking and lineage data** from images.
- **User-friendly** framework to navigate through this data. Easy to relate spatial information with hierarchical information. Easily orient the user in a possibly very large annotation.
- "Point-wise" **interactive editing** of the tracking and lineage data. Manual curation.
- **Semi-automatic and fully automatic tracking**.
- **Numerical features** and statistics on tracking data. **Tagging of this data**. Tags and numerical features can then be used to to enrich the visualization.
- **Extensible**: a 3rd party can build plugins for Mastodon:
  - Custom numerical feature analysers;
  - Custom tracking algorithms (detection and particle-linking algorithms);
  - General-use plugins.

## Mastodon components.

![BDV and TrackScheme](doc/Mastodon_BDV_and_TrackScheme.png)

### BDV windows.

Display image data and overlay the tracking data. Single objects (spots or links) can be individually edited.

![Multi-view image in BDV](doc/Mastodon_BDV-moving.png)

![Single track in BDV](doc/Mastodon_BDV-editing.png)

### TrackScheme windows.

TrackScheme is used to display a hierarchical view of the lineage data. The tracks are arranged from left to right, and time is laid out from top to bottom.

![TrackScheme example 3](doc/Mastodon_TracSchemeColoring_03.png)

## Mastodon technologies.

Mastodon is a Java software that relies on several technologies to achieve these goals, specially developed for it.

*Interactive visualization and navigation of large images thanks to the BigDataViewer* ([BDV](https://imagej.net/BigDataViewer). Any file that can be opened in the BDV will work in Mastodon (BDV HDF5 file format, KLB, Keller-Lab Blocks file format, N5 file format, ...). These file formats enable interactive visualization of multi-view TB dataset at the one-time cost of a file conversion. Also, they can be exploited for efficient image processing in special cases, taking advantage of multi-scale pyramidal representation and blocks decomposition. 

*[Mastodon-collection](https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon-collection): a high performance framework to manipulate collections of data*. Mastodon-collection was developed specifically for this project. It offers an in-memory compact layout storage of objects. Mastodon collections have a much smaller memory footprint. Objects in a mastodon collection are contiguous in memory. Thanks to CPU cache and [data locality](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/data-locality.html), iterating these collections is much faster than classical object collections. Mastodon-collection also offers techniques to do garbage-collection-free manipulations in Java, considerably improving the responsiveness of applications based on it.

*[Mastodon-graph](https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon-graph): a data structure based on mastodon-collection, and optimized for lineage and tracking data.* Mastodon-graph is a graph library based on mastodon-collections, that underlies the data model of Mastodon.

*Efficient retrieval of objects in space and time*. User interactions with tracking objects rely on [Kd-tree search on convex polytopes](http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/~pietzsch/polytope.pdf).

*Level of detail to display large number of objects*. TrackScheme automatically adapts the level of detail while displaying data at varying scales.
