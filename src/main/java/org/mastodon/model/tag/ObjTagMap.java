 * A property map specialized to assign (mutually exclusive) tags from a tag set

 * This map stores tags on the objects it is instantiated with. One object can
 * have at most one tag, or 0. It is nothing more than a glorified
 * {@link ObjPropertyMap}, with facilities to retrieve the objects that have
 * been tagged with a certain tag.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Tags must map to {@link Integer} IDs that are globally unique across all tag
 * sets. The default implementation ({@code DefaultObjTagMap}) is backed by a
 * {@link LabelSets} property of the objects (which can be shared among all
 * {@code DefaultObjTagMap}s).

 * @param <O>
